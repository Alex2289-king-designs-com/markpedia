**Andrew Richard Koenig** (`{{IPA-de|ˈkøːnɪç|IPA}}`{=mediawiki}; born
June 1952) is a former [AT&T](AT&T "wikilink") and [Bell
Labs](Bell_Labs "wikilink") researcher and programmer.[^1] He is the
author of *[C Traps and Pitfalls](C_Traps_and_Pitfalls "wikilink")*,
co-author (with [Barbara Moo](Barbara_E._Moo "wikilink")) of
*Accelerated C++* and *Ruminations on C++*, and his name is associated
with [argument-dependent name
lookup](argument-dependent_name_lookup "wikilink"), also known as
\"Koenig lookup\".[^2] He served as the Project Editor of the ISO/ANSI
standards committee for C++,[^3] has authored over 150 papers on
[C++](C++ "wikilink"), and is listed as inventor on four patents.[^4]

Early life and career {#early_life_and_career}
---------------------

Koenig was born in [New York City](New_York_City "wikilink"), and is the
son of the physicist, Dr. Seymour H. Koenig,[^5] a former director of
the [IBM Watson
Laboratory](Thomas_J._Watson_Research_Center "wikilink"), and Harriet
Koenig, an author and collector of Native American Indian art.[^6]

He graduated from [The Bronx High School of
Science](The_Bronx_High_School_of_Science "wikilink") in 1968 [^7] and
went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science
degree from [Columbia University](Columbia_University "wikilink") in New
York. He was a prominent member of the Columbia University Center for
Computing Activities (CUCCA) in the late 1960s and 1970s. He wrote the
first e-mail program used at the university.[^8]

In 1977, he joined the technical staff of Bell Labs in [Murray Hill, New
Jersey](Murray_Hill,_New_Jersey "wikilink"), from which he later
retired.

The first book he authored, in 1987, *C Traps and Pitfalls*, had been
motivated by his prior paper and work, mostly as a staff member at
Columbia University, on a different computer language,
[PL/I](PL/I "wikilink"). In 1977, as a recently hired staff member at
Bell Labs, he presented a paper called \"PL/I Traps and Pitfalls\" at a
[SHARE](SHARE_(computing) "wikilink") meeting in Washington, D.C.[^9]
